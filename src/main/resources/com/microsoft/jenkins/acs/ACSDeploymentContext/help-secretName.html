<div>
    The secret name that you can use in the Kubernetes Deployment configuration for the <code>imagePullSecrets</code>
    entry. Environment variable substitution are supported for the name input, so you can use available environment
    variables to construct the name dynamically, e.g., <code>some-secret-$BUILD_NUMBER</code>. The name should be in
    the pattern <code>[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*</code>, i.e., dot (.) concatenated
    sequences of hyphen (-) separated alphanumeric words.
    (See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/" title="Kubernetes Names">
    Kubernetes Names</a>)
    <p>
    If left blank, the plugin will generate a name based on the build name.
    <p>
    The secret name will be exposed with the environment variable <code>$KUBERNETES_SECRET_NAME</code>. You can use this
    in your Kubernetes configuration to reference the updated secret when the "Enable Variable Substitution in Config"
    option is enabled.
    <pre><code>
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: some.private.registry.domain/nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: $KUBERNETES_SECRET_NAME
</code></pre>
    <p>
    Note that once the secret is created, it will only be updated by the plugin. You have to manually delete it when it
    is not used anymore. If this is a problem, you may use fixed name so every time the job runs, the secret gets
    updated and no new secret is created.
