        Determine if the Docker credentials archive upload path specified above is shared among all the agents.
    </p>
    <p>
        To ease the shared files access, we may create share file storage for all the DC/OS agent nodes as
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/container-service-dcos-fileshare"
           target="_blank" title="Create and mount a file share to a DC/OS cluster">
            this documentation (Create and mount a file share to a DC/OS cluster)
        </a> suggests. With the help of the shared storage, we only need to upload the Docker credentials archive
        to the shared storage once, and all the agent nodes get the access to the resource immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check this option if the Docker credentials archive upload path is a shared storage path.
