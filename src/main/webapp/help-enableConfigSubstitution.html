    Substitute variables (in the form <code>$VARIABLE</code> or <code>${VARIABLE}</code>) in the configuration with
    values from Jenkins environment variables. This allows you to use dynamic values produced during the build in your
    Kubernetes configurations, e.g., a dynamically generated Docker image tag which will be used later by the
    Kubernetes deployment.
