    Substitute variables (in the form <code>$VARIABLE</code> or <code>${VARIABLE}</code>) in the configuration with
    values from Jenkins environment variables.
    <p>
    This allows you to use dynamic values produced during the build in your
    Kubernetes or DC/OS configurations, e.g., a dynamically generated Docker image tag which will be used later in the
    deployment.
